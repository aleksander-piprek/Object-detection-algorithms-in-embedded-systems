# Object detection algorithms in embedded systems
This is my Master's thesis, in which I will implement various object detection algorithms on different embedded platforms. Objective of this thesis is to determine the best combination and use case for each embedded device.  

software: C++, OpenCV, Python(possible), yolo, Alexnet, SSD

hardware: esp32, raspberry pi, jetson 

in progress...
