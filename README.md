# Object detection algorithms in embedded systems
This is my Master's thesis, in which I will implement various object detection algorithms on different embedded platforms. Objective of this thesis is to determine the best combination and use case for each embedded device.  

Software: C++, OpenCV, Python(possible), yolo, Alexnet, SSD

Hardware: raspberry pi and jetson
